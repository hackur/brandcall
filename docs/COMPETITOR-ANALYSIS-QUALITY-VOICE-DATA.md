## Messaging & Positioning

### Their Value Propositions

#### Primary Value Prop
> "Protect your phone reputation. As only a telephone carrier can."

This is their biggest differentiator - they claim only carriers can actually fix call delivery. They're right that software providers have limited control over carrier networks.

#### Secondary Value Props
1. **"No more showing up as Spam Likely"** - Direct pain point messaging
2. **"Increase Answer Rates by 48%+"** - Quantified outcome
3. **"Stop showing up as Scam Likely"** - Variation on spam messaging
4. **"More answered calls equals more profits"** - ROI focus
5. **"Reputation-Based Telecom"** - Category positioning

### Target Customer Segments

Based on their messaging and contact form segmentation:

| Segment | Volume | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Small Outbound Teams | <400 calls/mo | Basic needs |
| Growing Call Centers | 400-8k calls/mo | Scaling operations |
| Mid-Market Operations | 8k-65k calls/mo | Efficiency + compliance |
| Large Call Centers | 65k-250k calls/mo | Enterprise features |
| Enterprise | 250k-2.5M calls/mo | Custom solutions |
| High-Volume Enterprise | >2.5M calls/mo | Full-service partnership |

### Pain Points They Address

1. **"Spam Likely" labeling** - The #1 pain point, mentioned on every page
2. **Call blocking by carriers** - Calls not even reaching recipients
3. **Low answer rates** - <20% for unbranded calls (industry stat)
4. **Number reputation damage** - Spoofing and misuse issues
5. **Compliance complexity** - STIR/SHAKEN, TCPA requirements
6. **Lack of visibility** - Not knowing why calls fail

### Messaging We Can Adapt (Rewritten for BrandCall)

#### Original QVD Messaging → BrandCall Adaptation

**"Only a phone company can impact call delivery"**
→ *"BrandCall integrates with leading carriers to ensure your branded calls reach their destination."*

**"Consumers are overloaded with calls and less likely to pick up than ever before"**
→ *"When 80% of unknown calls go unanswered, your business name and logo make the difference."*

**"If your brand is showing up as 'spam likely' or 'unknown,' your calls will be ignored"**
→ *"Unknown numbers get ignored. Branded numbers get answered."*

**"It's going to quickly become a requirement if you want to be successful in this space"**
→ *"Branded caller ID isn't optional anymore—it's the new standard for professional outreach."*

**"It's akin to the ADT Security Sticker"** (on brand protection)
→ *"Your logo on the caller ID is like your brand's security badge—it tells customers this call is legitimate."*

## Pricing & Packaging

### Published Pricing (from their website)

| Component | Price | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Application Fee** | $750 one-time | FCC-required vetting |
| **SIP Trunking** | $0.012/minute | 6-second billing increments |
| **Curated Local CID** | $2.00/month/number | Includes CNAM storage |
| **BCID Impressions** | Up to $0.10/impression | Volume discounts available |
| **Google Verify** | Free | Included with SIP |
| **Monitoring** | Included | With number rental |

### Volume Tiers (from contact form)

Their segmentation suggests tiered pricing based on:
- <400 calls/mo
- 400-8k calls/mo
- 8k-65k calls/mo
- 65k-250k calls/mo
- 250k-2.49M calls/mo
- >2.5M calls/mo

### What We Can Learn

1. **One-time setup fee** - $750 for vetting establishes commitment and covers costs
2. **Per-minute + per-impression** - Dual revenue model (delivery + branding)
3. **Volume discounts** - Price "drops dramatically" with scale
4. **Bundled services** - Numbers + monitoring + remediation together
5. **No contracts, no minimums** - Reduces friction for new customers
6. **BCID Pricing Calculator** - They have a public calculator at bcidpricingcalculator.com

### BrandCall Pricing Comparison

| BrandCall Tier | Monthly Calls | Price/Call | vs QVD |
|----------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Starter | 10,000 | $0.075 | Higher but all-inclusive |
| Growth | 100,000 | $0.065 | Competitive |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | $0.025-0.050 | Volume competitive |

**Key Insight:** QVD's $0.012/min SIP + $0.10/impression for small volumes could exceed our pricing. We're competitive at scale but need to clarify our value vs. their carrier-direct model.

## Technical Documentation

### How They Explain Technical Concepts

QVD uses **plain language explanations** with minimal jargon:

> "A Attestation means that the telecom carrier knows the customer and knows that the Caller ID number is authorized for use by the customer. It lets the blocking and labeling algorithms know your call is not spoofed!"

They break down STIR/SHAKEN attestation levels clearly:
- **A Attestation** - Carrier knows you + your numbers ✅
- **B Attestation** - Carrier knows you but not your numbers ⚠️
- **C Attestation** - Carrier doesn't know you ❌ (blocked)

### Documentation Quality

**Strengths:**
- Plain English explanations
- Visual representations (checkmarks, icons)
- Educational blog content
- FAQs on product pages

**Weaknesses:**
- No public API documentation
- No developer portal
- Limited technical specifications
- No integration guides visible

### What BrandCall Should Adopt

1. **Plain language attestation explainer** - A/B/C levels in simple terms
2. **Visual flow diagrams** - How calls are signed and delivered
3. **Educational blog content** - STIR/SHAKEN explainers, best practices
4. **Industry glossary** - We already have this! (INDUSTRY-TERMS.md)
5. **FAQ sections on every product page**

### On Branded Caller ID

> "With over 4 billion robocalls being made each month, answer rates are on the decline."

> "95% of consumers reportedly ignore calls from unknown numbers."

### On Pain Points

> "Consumers are overloaded with calls and they're less likely to pick up their phones than ever before."

### On Their Approach
