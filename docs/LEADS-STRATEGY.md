## Pain Points We Solve

### 1. "Our Calls Don't Get Answered"

**The Problem**:
- 80% of unknown calls go unanswered
- Legitimate business calls indistinguishable from spam
- Expensive outbound efforts wasted

**Our Solution**:
- Branded display (name, logo, reason)
- Verified identity builds trust
- Answer rates increase 50-100%

**Quantified Value**:
```
Current: 1,000 calls/day × 20% answer = 200 conversations
With BrandCall: 1,000 calls/day × 40% answer = 400 conversations
Improvement: 100% more conversations, same cost
```

### 2. "Our Numbers Keep Getting Flagged as Spam"

**The Problem**:
- 25% of business numbers at risk of spam labels
- Once flagged, reputation is damaged
- "Number burning" is expensive

**Our Solution**:
- Proactive reputation monitoring
- Rapid remediation (1-3 day response)
- Best practices consulting
- 99.8% of numbers display clean

**Quantified Value**:
```
Average number burn cost: $500/number (provisioning, reputation loss)
Typical churn without protection: 20 numbers/month = $10,000/month
With BrandCall: <1 number flagged/month = $500/month
Savings: $9,500/month = $114,000/year
```

### 3. "We Can't Trust Our Lead Sources"

- No way to verify lead quality upstream

With fraud detection: Bad rate drops to 3%
Savings: $6,000/month = $72,000/year
```

## Sales Playbook

### Qualification Framework (BANT+)

| Criteria | Strong Signal | Weak Signal |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Budget** | Spending on Hiya/FO/Num | "Free solution only" |
| **Authority** | VP+, direct decision maker | Individual contributor |
| **Need** | Spam labels hurting now | "Exploring options" |
| **Timeline** | Active RFP, <90 days | "Next year maybe" |
| **Tech Fit** | Modern stack, API-ready | Legacy, no dev resources |
| **Volume** | >10,000 calls/month | <1,000 calls/month |

### Discovery Questions

**Pain Uncovering**:
1. "What percentage of your outbound calls are actually getting answered?"
2. "How many of your numbers are currently flagged as spam?"
3. "What's it costing you when calls don't connect?"
4. "How do you currently verify lead quality?"
5. "What visibility do you have into why calls fail?"

**Competitive Intel**:
1. "Are you using any caller ID or branded calling solution today?"
2. "What's working well? What's frustrating?"
3. "How much are you spending on number management?"

**Decision Process**:
1. "Who else would be involved in evaluating this?"
2. "What would success look like in 6 months?"
3. "What's driving the timeline for making a change?"

### Objection Handling

**"We already use Hiya/First Orion"**
> "Great—so you already see the value. What we hear from customers switching to us is [specific gaps]. Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how we compare?"

**"It's too expensive"**
> "Totally understand budget concerns. Let me show you the ROI math—most customers see payback in 60-90 days. What would a 50% increase in answer rates be worth to your team?"

**"We'll just keep rotating numbers"**
> "That's a common approach—but it's expensive and exhausting. Each burned number costs $500+. What if you never had to burn a number again?"

**"We don't have developer resources"**
> "That's actually one of our strengths. Our self-service dashboard means you don't need developers for day-to-day use. Most customers are live in a day with just a business user."

**"We need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What specific concerns should I address to help you make a decision? Would a pilot program reduce the risk for you?"
